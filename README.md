## Landing Page Project

Landing Page Project - Manipulating the DOM

## Description

This project was made in the scope of Udacity's Nanodegree. With aim to provide students with real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM, I had to build a landing page by combining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here, I set up a dinamic navigation bar menu which gives users the possibility to go through its added items as they scroll up or down. Please note that users also have the choiche to click at any time on any of the items of the navigation bar. By doing this, the section anchored to the item will be shown on the viewport. If a section is visible on the viewport, then the menu item will be highlighted with a gray background color.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
